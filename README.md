# Sweethouse  

Hey!  
This is a website I built for my girlfriendâ€™s upcoming pastry business, **Sweethouse**.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript  
- **Backend:** Java (Spring Boot)  
- **Tracking:** Kafka  
- **Authentication:** Clerk  

You can browse the available selection by clicking the different categories in the header, or by clicking the images at the bottom of the front page. Sign in is available through Clerk, and in the future there will be a page for the user to track their orders.
